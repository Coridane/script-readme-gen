  ## Description

  The function of this application is to create a README file based on user input. It will ask a series of questions and then build the file around the user's response. This will save time and ensure that nothing is missed in the README file.

  The technologies used in the development or operation of this application include Node.js as the runtime environment and the Inquirer module to produce the question and response functionality.
  
  The challenges of developing this application include understanding the use of promises and properly displaying the badges.
    
  Future development of this application will introduce flashier prompts (typerwriter-effect module). It will look at breaking the steps on a single question out to separate lines, and figuring out how to do starter text instead of the current recommended text which the user has to re-type. The Inquirer module's prefix, suffix, and default functions do not provide this).
