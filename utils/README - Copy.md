  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

  ## Description

  It allows me to answer a series of questions which will be used to create a README file.

  Node is the runtime environment and the Inquirer module is providing the question prompts.
  
  It was a challenge trying to get the badge to display properly.
    
  One change will be to leverage the typewriter-effect module for a prettier presentation.
